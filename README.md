### TODOs
[] click again on your vote to unvote.
[] background on chamath in case you don't know
[] overview of site / header for list of predictions?
[] handle comment count better to update based on your actions

[] handle db stuff properly - ask kai
[] filter predictions by time period? by category. politics, investment, business?
    [] drop down for year. scroll chronological.
    [] tabs for business vs politics. 
[] pop up and ask for source when you vote? seems painful.
[] separate comments from sources
[] in header put the number of predictions included

### More theoretical
[] add measure of "boldness" of prediction
